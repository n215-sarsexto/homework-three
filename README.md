This project is a beginning of the final project. It establishes the homepage for the travel-fly website, and is meant as a way to begin mobile responsive design. It also is a way to utilize classes, as there is a lot of repetitive information within this project. This assignment also served as a great introduction to properly create an online form with programming that is functional, outside of boxes and text on top of it. Much of the styling for this project came from an external source, and serves as practice to create a webpage from existing content.
